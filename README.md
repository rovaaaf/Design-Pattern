Design Patterns in Java with Real-World Examples

Welcome to the **Design Patterns in Java** repository! This project aims to showcase practical, real-world implementations of the most commonly used design patterns in Java. The goal is to make the understanding and application of design patterns easier by demonstrating them in action.

## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design. This repository provides hands-on examples to help you understand how to use these patterns effectively in Java. Each pattern is presented with:
- A problem that it solves.
- A step-by-step explanation.
- Code implementation with comments.
- A test or demonstration of how it works.

By studying these patterns, you'll gain a better understanding of how to write flexible, maintainable, and scalable code.
